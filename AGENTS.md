# Linger: Human and Agent collaboration centered on Rooms

This monorepo uses React/Vite for Web, Go for TeamHub and the Local Computer
Daemon, and TypeScript for the Agent Service, Document Runtime, LLM Wiki,
Memory, and Voice services.

## Common Commands

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline`: initialize Node dependencies
  in the current worktree when needed.
- `pnpm dev`: migrate the PostgreSQL that `TEAMHUB_DATABASE_URL` names, then run
  Web, TeamHub, and the node-services process (Agent Service, Memory, LLM Wiki,
  Document Runtime, Voice) on this machine, plus `livekit-server` from `PATH`
  while a voice key is set. It starts no containers; the developer runs
  PostgreSQL.
- `docker compose up --build`: build and run every service in containers,
  PostgreSQL and LiveKit included.
- `pnpm --filter @linger/web test <test-file>`: run one Web test (the script sets the Node flags jsdom needs).
- `pnpm --filter @linger/node-services exec vitest run <test-file>`: run one
  Node Services test, including the Agent Service's under `tests/agent/`.
- `make -C apps/teamhub test`: run TeamHub unit tests.
- `pnpm contracts:generate && pnpm contracts:verify`: regenerate and verify OpenAPI consumers.
- `make check BASE=<target-ref>`: run every app's fast check in parallel.
  `BASE` is required because the built-in Skill immutability check compares
  against it; the repository assumes no default branch.
- `make check-repository-gate BASE=<target-ref>`: run the repository gate
  (migration history, commitlint, env inventory, changed-file format and lint,
  script tests, doc links).
- Before opening a pull request, run the cheap gates listed under Important
  Conventions. Those are not the full suite.

## Structure

- `apps/web`: React Product Client; active product data comes only from TeamHub.
- `apps/teamhub`: Go service owning Account, Room, Work Item, and persisted collaboration state.
- `apps/node-services`: one Node process hosting the `agent` (Agent Service:
  Agent lifecycle, Runtime execution, and TeamHub callbacks), `memory`,
  `llm-wiki`, `document`, and `voice` roles selected by `NODE_SERVICES_ROLES`. Agent,
  Memory, and LLM Wiki share one HTTP port; the Document Runtime is the
  Hocuspocus/Yjs protocol and BlockNote/Yjs computation adapter on its own
  port, and it loads and saves native Documents' `document_bodies` rows in
  TeamHub's database. Voice supervises isolated ASR, recorder and Live workers from the voice-runtime package. TeamHub parses SKILL.md itself.
- `apps/teamhub-cli`: standalone Agent CLI calling TeamHub business APIs directly
  through the client generated from `teamhub-agent-api`; it owns its command
  schemas and host file helpers.
- `contracts`: authoritative cross-process OpenAPI and generated Go/TypeScript modules.
- `packages/document-model`: shared Room Document schema inspection and deterministic state helpers.
- `packages/service-kit`: shared isomorphic guards and helpers (`@linger/service-kit`) and the Node JSON logger and SHA-256 helper (`@linger/service-kit/node`).
- `skills`: versioned built-in Skill assets embedded into TeamHub.

## Important Conventions

- Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` for the target path.
- Keep each checkout's `node_modules` local; never symlink or copy another
  checkout's installed dependency tree. Run the install command above when
  dependency checks report missing or stale dependencies; do not disable the
  check to bypass it.
- Implement the simplest solution that satisfies the current request. Do not
  design for requirements outside the current scope, and prefer existing
  dependencies over new custom infrastructure.
- Before changing shared configuration (root or
  shared tool configs, shared scripts, env defaults), find every consumer with
  `rg` and check each affected app in the same pull request, not only the one being
  fixed.
- After the feature works, perform one explicit deletion pass: identify and
  remove code that is no longer needed and abstractions that the current
  request does not require.
- When retiring or reshaping a feature, delete its code and drop its tables,
  columns, rows, and stored files in a forward migration. Data that must
  survive is converted once inside the migration; do not keep dual-read or
  fallback paths for old shapes. This covers persisted state, config, and
  caches written by the Daemon or CLI on users' machines, but not
  compatibility with third-party tool versions such as Codex CLI.
- During local development, run the focused tests for the changed behavior and
  the affected fast boundary checks. Focused Vitest or Go unit tests do not
  replace those gates. Do not run complete integration, E2E, container, or
  reliability suites by default; `make check BASE=<target-ref>` runs only the
  fast checks. Run a focused heavy scenario when
  changing that test or harness, reproducing its failure, or when real
  database, process, concurrency, or recovery semantics cannot be proved at a
  lower layer.
- Before opening a pull request, run the cheap gates for every touched app.
  These are local and do not need Postgres, containers, or the full suite:
  - Web: `make check-web` (typecheck, unit tests, and React Doctor). If the
    change adds a static import on the Room or app initial graph, also run
    `pnpm --filter @linger/web run build:assets` to check the initial JS
    budget.
  - TeamHub: `make -C apps/teamhub fmt-check` and
    `go test ./tests/integration/layout -count=1` (structural layout rules, no
    database; it has no budget to update).
  - Other apps: the matching `make check-<app>` or package `check` /
    `typecheck` from that app's `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep the owning documentation aligned in the same pull request when a change
  affects user-visible behavior, service or module ownership, cross-process
  flows or contracts, permissions, filesystem paths, lifecycle, recovery, or
  failure semantics: the nearest `AGENTS.md` or README. Keep progress and
  checklists in the issue tracker.
- Do not import source across `apps/*` boundaries. Share in-process code through
  packages and cross-process data through generated contracts.
- Edit `contracts/openapi/`, never `contracts/generated/`; regenerate after contract changes.
- When adding an app, give it a `make check-<app>` fast check and add it to
  `FAST_CHECKS` (or `HEAVY_CHECKS`) in the root `Makefile`. Add or change Make targets only when no
  existing target represents the new boundary.
- Ordinary business files and new OpenAPI component documents must not require
  Makefile edits. Create the component, `$ref` it from a top-level contract,
  and regenerate contracts. A new top-level contract is one entry in
  `contractEntries` in `contracts/codegen/contracts.ts`.
- Pull requests touching the user message → `provider_ready` path must state whether they add a
  network round trip or file walk while the user waits, and justify it or keep it
  off the critical path.
- Keep secrets in the ignored root `.env`; never commit or print credentials.
- Every environment variable that runtime code reads must be in `.env.example`
  or listed in `scripts/env-inventory.json` with its owner; prefer a code
  default over a new variable. `pnpm env:inventory:check` enforces this in
  `make check-repository` and `make check-repository-gate`. `.env.example` keeps every
  entry active with the value `pnpm dev` uses (the code default or the
  matching `scripts/local-defaults.env` value), so a copied template turns on
  every feature that needs no personal key; only personal keys (Composio,
  Soniox) stay empty. Comment out only entries whose value depends on the host
  or would break a mode (for example `NODE_ENV`, `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`).
  Every fixed local default for `pnpm dev` lives in
  `scripts/local-defaults.env`; `scripts/with-local-env.mjs` only merges files.
- The repository is English-only, human-facing docs included. Write new and
  changed doc text in English and do not add Chinese to any existing doc.

## Cross-Module Conventions

New and changed code follows these targets. Do not migrate untouched code only
to comply.

- HTTP errors use one envelope,
  `{"error": {"code", "message", "request_id", "details"?}}`, with UPPER_SNAKE
  codes declared in the OpenAPI component. Go handlers write it through
  `writeError`; never return a bare `{"error": "..."}` or a hand-built `gin.H`.
- Logging: Go uses `slog`; Node services log through the injected
  `createJsonLogger` from `@linger/service-kit/node`, never `console.*`
  (CLIs print plain text). Events are `<area>.<what>` with snake_case fields.
- Configuration: each app reads the environment in one config module
  (`config.ts`, `internal/config`) and passes typed values down. Do not read
  `process.env` or `os.Getenv` elsewhere or write to `process.env`; each
  default lives in exactly one place.
- Shared helpers: guards, hashing, sleep, and IDs come from
  `@linger/service-kit` or `internal/ids`. Add a helper there once a second
  app needs it; never copy one.
- Naming: `TeamHub`/`teamHub` in identifiers (`teamhub` only in paths,
  packages, and CLI names). Handwritten Go uses initialisms (`ID`, `URL`,
  `HTTP`).
- TypeScript: export functions as `function` declarations; object types are
  `interface` (lint-enforced); private class state uses `#field`.
- Comments are English and explain why or state an invariant; never restate
  the code. No issue or pull request numbers, plan-step labels, or history
  ("previously", "used to"). Exported Go declarations and packages have doc
  comments; `make -C apps/teamhub lint-go BASE=<target-ref>` checks this on new
  and changed declarations only.
- Do not drive behavior by matching natural-language wording: user text,
  third-party error prose, model prose, or our own human-readable labels.
  Carry the decision in structured fields, error codes, or model structured
  output, and keep human-readable text for display only.
- Code, comments, logs, user-facing strings, prompts, Skills, tests, fixtures,
  and benchmark data contain no Chinese. Serve users of any language through
  language-agnostic mechanisms: engine language settings, structured fields,
  model structured output, and prompts that answer in the user's language.
  Never add per-language keyword lists, regexes, or model-facing examples.
  Tests that need non-ASCII or unspaced text use escaped code points, accented
  Latin, emoji, or another unspaced script.
