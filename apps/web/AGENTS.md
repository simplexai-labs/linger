# Web: Vite React Product Client for TeamHub

React Router Data Mode and TanStack Query power the active Room-first UI.

## Common Commands

- `pnpm --filter @linger/web test <test-file>`: run one test. Use the script, not `exec vitest`: it disables Node's experimental Web Storage, which hides jsdom's `localStorage`.
- `pnpm --filter @linger/web typecheck`: typecheck Web.
- `pnpm --filter @linger/web test:build`: run real Vite build configuration tests (`*.build.test.ts`, also run by `make check-web-build`).
- `make check-web`: run Web types, tests, and React diagnostics. Run this
  before opening a pull request. If the change adds a static import on the
  Room or app initial graph, also run `pnpm --filter @linger/web run
build:assets` to check the initial JS budget.

## Structure

- `src/app`: routes, providers, route error boundaries, and global CSS.
- `src/features/teamhub`: Human API, Session, error, and realtime adapters.
- `src/features/rooms`: Room routes, Chat, Timeline, the right sidebar (Agent Info, Activity, Thread, Document) and membership UI.
- `src/test`: unit-test support, including the in-process TeamHub test server.
- `e2e`: Playwright product workflows; every spec runs on the real TeamHub and
  Document Runtime stack (`make check-e2e-room-document`).

## Important Conventions

- Active product data comes from TeamHub, never retired Workspace APIs. Web has
  no fixture backend and no build mode that swaps TeamHub out.
- Unit tests that need TeamHub use `createTestTeamHubRuntime`
  (`src/test/teamhub-test-runtime.ts`): the real typed client against an
  in-process `TeamHubTestServer` that answers seeded reads. Declare every write a
  test depends on with `runtime.server.on(...)` or an `accept*` helper; an
  undeclared request fails with `TEST_ROUTE_MISSING`. Tests of one client call
  may inject `fetchRequest` (`fetchDouble`) instead.
- Unit tests must not depend on machine speed: rely on the global 5s async wait (Testing Library and `vi.waitFor`) instead of per-test `timeout` options, use fake timers for time-based behavior, and put real Vite/Rollup builds in `*.build.test.ts`.
- TanStack Query owns remote state; route loaders only ensure feature-owned queries.
- Components do not handwrite TeamHub endpoints or wire DTOs. Every TeamHub
  request names a generated contract path through the `openapi-fetch` client in
  `src/features/teamhub/teamhub-api.ts`; SSE, XHR upload, and download URLs use
  its `teamHubUrl`.
- Web never serves the Local Computer release. The Agent Service owns
  `/install/`: the production static host forwards `/install/`,
  `/v1/runner-gateway`, `/v1/local-mcp-relay/`, and `/v1/context-content/` to
  `TEAMHUB_NODE_SERVICES_URL` when it is set, and Vite
  development forwards `/install/` to the local Agent Service listener. Both
  hosts forward the Computer `teamhub` CLI's `/api/agent/` to
  `TEAMHUB_BASE_URL`, so a Computer needs only the Web origin.
  Never bundle installers or CLI releases into Web.
- Effects owning SSE, WebSocket, polling, timers, or subscriptions may depend only on resource identity; UI callbacks and presentation state must not recreate them. Lifecycle changes require a test proving unrelated rerenders do not resubscribe and identity changes clean up exactly once.
- Browser configuration for local Vite reads `import.meta.env.VITE_*`
  through the app config boundary. Production builds follow the page origin
  (same-origin TeamHub `/v0` and Document Runtime `/document-collaboration`)
  so one image works on every gateway, test environment, and deployed
  environment.
- Use Tailwind and local components; do not add a broad UI library. Render UI icons
  only through `Icon` from `src/components/ui/icon.tsx` with
  `@hugeicons/core-free-icons` (14px in rows and menus, 16px in buttons and the
  rail); `lucide-react` remains only in the Runtime activity views
  (`src/features/rooms/task-sidebar/adapters/runtime-history-view.tsx` and
  `src/features/rooms/runtime-status/runtime-tool-presentation.ts`).
- Styling: Tailwind utilities plus design tokens are the standard. Use token
  classes (Town semantic tokens such as `text-muted-foreground`, or
  `--color-app-*` roles such as `text-app-ink`) instead of hex arbitrary values;
  when no token fits, add one to `src/app/visual-theme.css` and the
  `@theme inline` block in `src/app/globals.css`.
- Compose conditional class names with `cn` from `src/lib/cn.ts`.
- Do not add CSS Modules or feature-level `.css` files, and do not add new hex
  colors in TSX. Use inline `style` only for runtime-computed values.
- Keep element-level CSS resets (for example `button, input { font: inherit }`) inside
  `@layer base`; unlayered rules beat Tailwind utilities and silently disable `text-*`
  classes. Reference CSS variables for font families with
  `font-(family-name:--var)`, never `font-[var(--var)]`, which Tailwind reads as a
  font-weight.
- Two Tailwind utilities that set the same CSS property are resolved by their order
  in the generated stylesheet, not by their order in the `className` string. Writing
  the one you want last does nothing. Never stack competing `display` or `position`
  utilities on one element, and never pass such a utility to a component that already
  hardcodes one: `.relative` is emitted after `.absolute`, so an `absolute` handed to
  a component whose base classes include `relative` is dropped and the element falls
  back into normal flow; `.block` is emitted after `.line-clamp-*`, so adding `block`
  replaces the `display:-webkit-box` the clamp needs and the clamp stops truncating.
  Put the conflicting utility on a wrapper element instead. Neither typecheck nor
  React Doctor catches this and it renders fine in unit tests, so assert the outcome
  (the wrapper carries the positioning, the clamped node carries no `block`) in a test
  and confirm that test fails when the utility is put back on the same element.
